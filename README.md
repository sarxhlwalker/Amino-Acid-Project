# Amino-Acid-Project

## Description

An Excel project to simplify protein bonds between amino acids and drugs and whatnot. 

## Instructions

1. delete unnecessary information from the .txt file. The first line should not begin with column headers but the data itself.
2. copy-paste Sub file into "Developer" -> "View Code" 
3. some values are hard-coded (ex. name of .txt file); be sure to adjust as needed
4. press "run"

Hope this helps :)
