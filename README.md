# Amino-Acid-Project

- copy-paste code into "Developer" -> "View Code" 
- tested with one sample file; file may have been edited to remove unnecessary information at top at bottom (ex. user information); please ensure your file looks similar to sample file -- let me know if a different file doesn't work (and send it over!)
- a couple values are hardcoded (ex. file that's to be read; approximate size of empty spaces, etc.); these can all be easily adjusted if too small

Hope this helps :)
