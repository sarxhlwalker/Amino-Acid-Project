# Amino-Acid-Project

## Description

A Python project that will return a comma delimited file for easy importing into Excel. Both target values and source values will be sorted in ascending numerical order. 

## Instructions

1. Delete unnecessary information from the .txt file. The first line should not begin with column headers but the data itself. Please also delete the unnecessary information at the bottom, and there should be no extra spaces before/after/between lines. 
2. Run `main.py`. Call `read_file()` in the console with the pathname of the file you wish to read and the desired name of the output file. Remember to specify the type of file (ex. `.txt` or `.csv`) you wish to create. The file will be written into the project directory; you can find it in Finder to open in Excel. 

Hope this helps :)
