# Amino-Acid-Project

## Description

A Python project that will return a comma delimited file for easy importing into Excel. The target values will be sorted by their numerical order, but not the source values. 

## Instructions

1. Delete unnecessary information from the .txt file. The first line should not begin with column headers but the data itself. Please also delete the unnecessary information at the bottom. 
2. Run `main.py`; call `load_file()` with the pathname of the file you wish to read and the desired name of the output file. The file will be written into the project directory; you can find it in Finder to open in Excel. 
3. When opening the file in Excel, go through the necessary steps to format it by comma separation (instead of the automatic tab). 

Hope this helps :)
